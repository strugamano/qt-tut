# qt-tut

Demo files and cheatsheets for developing GUI applications with [Qt6](https://www.qt.io/product/qt6), using the [pyside6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/) module.

The code is based on the tutorial pages of [Qt for Python](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/index.html) and [pythonguis](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyside6/).

The files are named after the corresponding tutorial section where the introduced functionality is covered. Links to the exact tutorial page can be found in the source files.

The [icons](https://store.kde.org/p/2068651) used in the apps are open source.

## howto

The code was written and tested on Manjaro Linux, so any Linux distribution with [Python 3+](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html) and [Qt6](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/get-and-install-qt.html) installed with the required dependencies should suffice. You can install these from the package manager.

The code should *somewhat* work on Windows as well, you can find installation guides through the links above.

You will need the [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) python package manager to set up [pyside6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/).
